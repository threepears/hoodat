# Front End Capstone: HOODAT

A search application specifically for looking up musical artists. Final front-end capstone project at NSS.

### Goal

Create a search application which is totally music-focused, so that relevant artist information can be obtained easily. Use music-based APIs to gather and display artist photo, biography, list of albums with year of release, and three relevant videos to watch. Have the ability to log in and save your searches as "past searches" for later use.

### Tools Used

Angular, Bootstrap, Firebase, JQuery, Sass, Rovi Music API, YouTube API, Code editor

### Installation

Create a new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/threepears/hoodat.git
```

Then start your http server in the project folder with this Terminal command:

```sh
$ http-server
```

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to see and use the app!
